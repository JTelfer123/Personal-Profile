<h1>My IT Profile</h1>
  <img src="Joshua.jpg" alt="Me With Paint Brushes" width=100 height=150>
  <h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p> My name is Joshua William Telfer and I was born on the 19th of July 1999 to my parents Robert and Joanne.
   I am the eldest of four brothers and despite my parents both having brown and black hair, I came out a ginger (lucky).
   I was raised in a typical middle class Australian home, having completed year 12 in 2017 and then moving straight into full time work.
    Going through high school, I loved rowing and found myself joining the school rowing team.
    This led me down a path of being permanently linked to keeping fit and working out, so that’s what I spend most of my time doing besides working and video games.
     I also have a keen interest in learning French and am doing my best to become at least basically proficient in it. <p/>
    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>My father is an electronics technician by trade, having worked for Clipsal for a number of years. His keen interest in things like home theatre, (at the time) recent video games and building a family computer really piqued my interest at a very young age in all things technology. Ever since then I’ve had a keen eye for different systems and computers, which has translated into being able to quickly handle new equipment and technology in my current workplace. While I do work in a communication services role, I wanted to be able to undertake tertiary learning and advance my knowledge of IT, which led me to starting this Bachelor at RMIT.
So far I have completed the Introduction to Programming foundation unit, which may hopefully help out in future assignments for Introduction to IT.
In my studies I expect to learn things like network management, in depth programming in a few object-oriented languages and how to function as a team on an IT project. </p>
